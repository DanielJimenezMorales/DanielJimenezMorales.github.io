Hello! My name is Daniel and I am a spanish Netcode programmer. 

### My story
I discovered my passion and interest for the netcode branch of game dev in one of my Videogames design and development degree's subject at University. From that moment, I decided to go beyond that subject and start learning from papers, blogs and code repositories. A few months later I decided I wanted to base my final university degree project in creating an online multiplayer First Person Shooter prototype. At the moment I keep developing that project.

### My skills
My hard skills are:
- C#
- Unity Engine
- Netcode For GameObjects Framework
- Git
- SOLID principles
- Clean Code

My soft skills are:
- Analysis capacity and critical thinking. I regard myself as an open minded person as I take into consideration different points of view when approaching a problem, analyzing both the potential benefits and drawbacks of each solution.
- Time management.
- Teamwork.

### My personal hobbies
Outside of the realm of programming and Netcode, I enjoy:
- Gaming
- Reading
- Hiking
- Padel
- Djing
