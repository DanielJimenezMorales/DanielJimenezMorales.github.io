Hello! My name is Daniel and I am a spanish Netcode programmer. 

## Online Multiplayer FPS Prototype
![Online Multiplayer FPS Prototype cover image](/assets/img/online-multiplayer-FPS-prototype-cover-image.JPG){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
I discovered my passion and interest for the netcode branch of game dev in one of my Videogames design and development degree's subject at University. From that moment, I decided to go beyond that subject and start learning from papers, blogs and code repositories. A few months later I decided I wanted to base my final university degree project in creating an online multiplayer First Person Shooter prototype. At the moment I keep developing that project.
