Hello! My name is Daniel and I am a spanish Netcode programmer. 

### My story
I discovered my passion and interest for the netcode branch of game dev in one of my Videogames design and development degree's subject at University. From that moment, I decided to go beyond that subject and start learning from papers, blogs and code repositories. A few months later I decided I wanted to base my final university degree project in creating an online multiplayer First Person Shooter prototype.

Hi! I'm Daniel, a game programmer whose expertise lies in the intersection that combines gameplay systems with network/multiplayer since it is one of my biggest interests in game development

My primary goal is to provide players with the best networked experience, addressing and mitigating all network-related issues that typically occur in online multiplayer games. To ensure a high-quality and seamless gameplay, it is crucial to employ various netcode strategies such as latency compensation techniques that I have been learning and mastering over the years.

### My skills
- Engines: Unity
- Languages: C#, C++
- Network: TCP, UDP, RUDP, BSD Sockets, Client-Server, Snapshot interpolation, Latency compensation techniques, Server authority, Hit Registration
- Others: Multi-threaded programming, SOLID, OOP, Game design patterns

My soft skills are:
- Analysis capacity and critical thinking. I regard myself as an open minded person as I take into consideration different points of view when approaching a problem, analyzing both the potential benefits and drawbacks of each solution.
- Time management.
- Teamwork.

### My personal hobbies
Outside of the realm of programming and Netcode, I enjoy:
- Gaming
- Reading
- Hiking
- Padel
- Djing
